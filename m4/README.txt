what we did (corresponding with numbers):
1. write sector.
2. delete file.
3. write a file.
4. copy a file.
5. list the direct contents.
6. create file

how to test:
1. test with 2.
2. In shell, first "delete messag" and "type messag", the messag should be losing.
    (Can also be tested by dir)
3. test with 4.
4. In shell, first "copy messag m2", then "type me", the same message as messag should be printed out.
5. In shell, type "dir", and you will get the list of files and their sizes (yeah, extra!)
6. In shell, type "create (what ever the file is)",
then keep typing until enter an empty list, then the file is created. Feel free to test with above functions.
