For m5, what we did (corresponding with numbers):
1. time interrupt.
2. process table.
3. load program.
4. scheduling.
5. kill process.
6. process blocking.

how to test:
1. Basically, try "execute phello", that would explain almost everything.
2. When running that, try typing "dir", and it will show the files. It
is hard to catch.
3. When executing phello, try "kill 1", and it will stop the process immediately.
When you start another phello, it will start from the beginning.
4. Finally, try "execforeground phello", and you will not be able to do anything until it finishes.
